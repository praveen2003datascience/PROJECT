# Intelligent Mental Health Prediction Using NLP

This research project focuses on developing an intelligent system for mental health prediction based on treatment session transcript data. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques, the system identifies patterns associated with mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

üîπ Project Overview

Objective: Early diagnosis of mental health disorders from therapy session transcripts.

Approach: Utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to capture linguistic context and semantic patterns in clinical text.

Application Areas:

Clinical support systems

Telemedicine platforms

Mental health monitoring tools

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. Data Preparation

Cleaning and preprocessing raw transcript text

Tokenization and formatting for transformer models

Handling domain-specific linguistic nuances

2. Model Selection

Pre-trained BERT model for contextual embedding

Fine-tuning with mental health-specific transcript datasets

3. Training & Optimization

Fine-tuning for domain adaptation

AdamW optimizer for efficient convergence and better generalization

Baseline performance evaluation, followed by iterative improvement

4. Prediction & Insights

Forecasts mental health states from new transcript inputs

Provides actionable insights into emotional and psychological patterns

Supports proactive interventions and monitoring

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Programming: Python

Libraries & Frameworks: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy

Deep Learning Models: BERT, RoBERTa (optional for benchmarking)

Optimization: AdamW

Visualization & Analysis: Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorBoard

üìä Expected Outcomes

‚úî Early detection of mental health issues
‚úî Improved adaptability through fine-tuning on domain data
‚úî Reliable and scalable prediction system
‚úî Integration possibilities in clinical and telemedicine applications

üìå Future Scope

Incorporating multimodal data (voice tone, facial expressions, physiological signals)

Expanding to other mental health conditions

Explainability through attention visualization, SHAP, or LIME
